This project is a performance- and privacy-focused word processor. It's completely static so that none of your data is collected on my end. This project is currently quite limited; if you want a more complete project, you can check out my l-class repository, which will be released soon.
I've ensured this project is stable and have tested many features without encountering any problems.
If you encounter any errors or issues, please email me at pl2def24@gmail.com so we can resolve them. Thank you for your feedback.
